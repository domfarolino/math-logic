# Mathematical Logic

This repository contains notes, sample code, and completed assignments
for the graduate Mathematical Logic course at the University of Cincinnati.
The course focuses on math logic concepts brought to life with the
[Lean Theorem Prover](https://github.com/leanprover/lean), by Microsoft
Research.

There is a top-level folder for each assignment, but the "meat"
(sorry vegetarians) of this repository can be found in the `Notes/` folder.
In here are fairly detailed notes from the following books used in this course,
and written on behalf of the Lean folks:

 - [Logic and Proof](https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/)
 - [Theorem Proving in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/)

The notes include `.lean` files, as well as pictures of natural deduction proofs
on paper (mostly relevant to the first book in that list).
